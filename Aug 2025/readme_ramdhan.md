🕰️ **Time to Break Some Rules** 

Imagine you've stumbled upon a hidden kernel module on a deep server... a mysterious **'Temporal Paradox Engine'** that claims to let you manipulate time itself.

The researcher insists it's perfectly stable, that its "Local Causality" model prevents any paradoxes. But you have a hunch... there's a flaw in its fundamental logic that could collapse the entire timeline.

Your job? **Craft an exploit** that creates a paradox, **shatters the engine's protections**, and gives you ultimate control of the system. 

*Be subtle though - the kernel is watching...* 🥷

## 🎯 Challenge Rules:
- Submit your winning solutions (exploit source code, flag, and writeup) via [this form](https://forms.gle/r9UF5LMqE7vsHpjo7)
- Think you've cracked the bug but running out of time? Send us your writeup describing how you'd exploit it!
- **Ready to bend time?** [Download the files here](https://github.com/star-sg/challenges/raw/refs/heads/main/Aug%202025/for_participant.zip)!
- Zip password: `not-quite-baby-kernel`
- Connect to `tcp:159.223.33.156:9102` to get your shell
- **Mission**: Load your exploit → get root → read the flag!

## File Verification:
**SHA256**: `42b6aa47bd93d45dee7956b773be17f56412a33cfeeaa4f369404da602ac6ab9`
